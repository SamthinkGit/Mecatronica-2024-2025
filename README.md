## Welcome to the Mechatronics 2024 Repository

This repository contains the assignments completed during the **Mechatronics 2024-2025** course by user [SamthinkGit](https://github.com/SamthinkGit). Before exploring, please keep the following recommendations in mind:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important! 

This repository is fully designed to be **deployed as a web page**. The reason for this is detailed some sections below.

- You can access the full documentation now deployed online at this link: [Web Page Link](#).
  - This is the **recommended** way to view the content.

- If you prefer to view it locally, follow these steps:
  1. Run the command `python -m http.server` from the project‚Äôs root directory.
  2. Open your browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Content Structure

1. All documentation is in Markdown (.md) format and located in the `/content` folder.
   - While you can view the files directly, we recommend using the deployed page or the local setup for a better experience.
2. Additionally, this repository includes a [Wiki](#) with the same information as the `/content` folder.

### About the commits

- All work has been managed from the root directory.
- To check the progress, use:
  ```
  git log --oneline
  ```

## How this page works

The main goal of this project is to practice Markdown format. For this reason, we decidde to empower this practice and take the next step. In this repository **the entire page is built from `.md` files**!.

- A JavaScript script (located in `/scripts/markdown.js`) processes the documents in the `/content` folder (where the .md files are located) and generates automatically the deployed pages.
- We use the [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library to convert Markdown files to HTML.

Feel free to explore and reuse the script, but we kindly ask that you credit the library used.

### Explore and enjoy!

Finally, we invite you to explore this repository and use it however you like. We hope you find the shared information helpful!
