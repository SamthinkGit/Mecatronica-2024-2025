# 🛠️ Introduction
<hr>

Welcome to the main repository for our cutting-edge project on the implementation of ECM (Execution-Cognition Machine) as a strategic approach towards the development of Computer Autonomous AI. This initiative represents a significant leap in crafting an intelligent system that not only mimic but also evolve human-like cognitive functionalities autonomously in computer interaction.

The project revolves around designing, testing, and refining theoretical models that translate complex human problem-solving capabilities into computational strategies executable by AI. We integrate advanced AI frameworks, particularly focusing on AutoGPT as the backbone for adaptive and scalable solutions. Our system architecture is robust, accommodating rapid iterations and rigorous validations through continuous integration and deployment mechanisms.

For detailed insights into our methodologies and system functionalities, please refer to the README, the documentation included in this repository or surf through the pages of this Wiki.

```python
def get_config():

# --- Loading Config ---
config_path = os.path.join(get_mlbasics_path(), "config", "config.yaml")
with open(config_path, 'r') as stream:
    config_yaml = yaml.safe_load(stream)

# --- Loading Logging ---
logging.basicConfig(
    format="%(levelname)s - %(name)s -  %(message)s",
    level=config_yaml['general']['logging_level']
)
```
